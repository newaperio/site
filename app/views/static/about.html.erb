		<h1>About NewAperio</h1>
		<p>Our story is kind of cool. We&rsquo;re two Louisiana boys who love technology. One day a while back we were sitting around talking about technology. We realized that our idea of the future matched up and that we both wanted to affect that future directly. It was then that NewAperio was born, but we didn&rsquo;t quite know what that meant.</p>
	
		<p>Fast-forward two years in the future: Logan was in college working on a degree in computer engineering and Evan was starting his in math and physics. Logan had this crazy idea to actually start a company &mdash; like legitimately. So, we filed with the government, got our papers, and then realized that we didn&rsquo;t have the slightest idea what to do next.</p>
	
		<p>Our first project was a product we called Twoschedule. It&rsquo;s a personal productivity app. We were both so busy, so we came up with this neat system to keep focus and context on the tasks at hand. It helped us immensely, so we built it, launched it and then tried to get it to take off. It had modest success, but never really took us anywhere. So we began to think about what was next.</p>
	
		<p>Somewhere along the way, we started helping out people. There&rsquo;s a lot of entrepreneurs where we are who have some pretty awesome ideas, but no technical ability to bring those ideas to market. We started working with these fellow entrepreneurs, because we do have the skills and the knowhow. We helped them refine their idea, build a business plan, plan effective monetization schemes and, finally, build the product. As it turns out, we were a lot better at this than working on our own ideas. Plus, it was fun.</p>
	
		<p>So, we shifted. And now, after some time, we&rsquo;re fully embracing this model. We help entrepreneurs. They come to us with an idea and we turn it into reality. They&rsquo;re passionate about their ideas, and we&rsquo;re passionate about helping them turn it into reality.</p>
		
		<p>And so, that&rsquo;s what we are: engineers and entrepreneurs.</p>
	
		<p>We&rsquo;re having a blast.</p>
	
		<p>From Baton Rouge, with love,<br />
