		<h1>About NewAperio</h1>
		<p>NewAperio was founded in 2010 by Logan Leger while a student at Louisiana State University. After a few &mdash; failed &mdash; attempts at founding internet startups, Logan used the skills he had garnered in building, managing and directing web and mobile products to start a new kind of entrepreneurially-focused development firm.</p>
		<p>Our name is unique. <strong>Aperio</strong> (pronounced uh-pair-e-o) is a Latin word meaning &ldquo;to uncover&rdquo;. We believe that&rsquo;s what we help our clients do: to discover their hidden potential through web and mobile apps. The <strong>New</strong> part emphasizes the ever-changing nature of our industry: by reminding ourselves &mdash; daily &mdash; of the constant evolution of the web and mobile platforms, we commit ourselves to constantly challenge and expand what we know.</p>
